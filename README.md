# 🧠 Crime × Neuroscience: Behavioral Trends from 35 Years of Data  

### 🔎 Project Aim
This project analyzes **35 years (1975–2010)** of US crime data to uncover large-scale behavioral patterns.  
We use **data science + neuroscience insights** to explore how stress, fear, and environmental factors influence decision-making and crime rates.  

---

### 🧠 Why Neuroscience?  
Crime is ultimately a behavior. This project connects data trends to neuroscience concepts like:  
- **Stress & Impulse Control:** Chronic stress impairs the prefrontal cortex, making impulsive behaviors more likely.  
- **Fear & Coercion:** Explains vulnerability to wrongful convictions and false confessions.  
- **Reward Systems:** How the brain’s dopamine circuits drive risk-taking behaviors.

### 📊 What This Repo Will Contain  
1. **Data Cleaning Notebook** – how raw data was prepared  
2. **4 Core Visualizations:**  
   - Violent crimes over time  
   - State-by-state crime intensity (heatmap)  
   - Crime type breakdown  
   - Predictive analysis (future trend estimate)  
3. **Neuroscience-based insights** for each graph

### 🧠 Neuroscience Insight: Crime Trends (1975–2015)

The graph above isn’t just about numbers. Neuroscience research suggests that crime patterns can be influenced by how the human brain responds to **stress, trauma, and reward**.  

1. **Stress & Impulse Control:**  
   - Chronic stress weakens the **prefrontal cortex** (the brain's "logic & self-control" center) and strengthens the **amygdala** (fear & emotion center).  
   - Periods of economic uncertainty or social unrest can increase impulsive, fear-driven behaviors, potentially leading to higher crime rates.  

2. **Reward Pathways:**  
   - Crimes like robbery or assault can trigger the same **dopamine-based reward circuits** as addictive behaviors.  
   - When legitimate opportunities for reward are scarce, people may seek “shortcuts” through illegal means.  

3. **Generational Trauma:**  
   - Communities exposed to long-term instability or discrimination can pass down **epigenetic changes** that alter stress regulation.  
   - This heightened baseline stress may correlate with increased crime rates in specific populations.  

> **Key Takeaway:** Crime patterns reflect more than just social factors. Neuroscience shows how external stressors and internal brain mechanisms interact to shape human behavior over time.

## 🔍 How We Arrived at These Insights  

1. **Step 1:** We analyzed the US crime dataset from 1975–2015 and plotted trends across violent crimes, homicides, assaults, and robberies.  
2. **Step 2:** We compared spikes/drops in the data with known historical events (economic recessions, social unrest, policy changes).  
3. **Step 3:** We overlaid findings from neuroscience literature on stress, trauma, and impulse control to explain possible causes for these trends.
