# ðŸ§  Crime Ã— Neuroscience: Behavioral Trends from 35 Years of Data  

### ðŸ”Ž Project Aim
This project analyzes **35 years (1975â€“2010)** of US crime data to uncover large-scale behavioral patterns.  
We use **data science + neuroscience insights** to explore how stress, fear, and environmental factors influence decision-making and crime rates.  

---

### ðŸ§  Why Neuroscience?  
Crime is ultimately a behavior. This project connects data trends to neuroscience concepts like:  
- **Stress & Impulse Control:** Chronic stress impairs the prefrontal cortex, making impulsive behaviors more likely.  
- **Fear & Coercion:** Explains vulnerability to wrongful convictions and false confessions.  
- **Reward Systems:** How the brainâ€™s dopamine circuits drive risk-taking behaviors.

### ðŸ“Š What This Repo Will Contain  
1. **Data Cleaning Notebook** â€“ how raw data was prepared  
2. **4 Core Visualizations:**  
   - Violent crimes over time  
   - State-by-state crime intensity (heatmap)  
   - Crime type breakdown  
   - Predictive analysis (future trend estimate)  
3. **Neuroscience-based insights** for each graph

### ðŸš€ Future Scope  
- Build an interactive dashboard  
- Explore wrongful conviction psychology  
- Apply predictive modeling with neuroscience framing
