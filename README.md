# 🧠 Crime × Neuroscience: Behavioral Trends from 35 Years of Data  

### 🔎 Project Aim
This project analyzes **35 years (1975–2010)** of US crime data to uncover large-scale behavioral patterns.  
We use **data science + neuroscience insights** to explore how stress, fear, and environmental factors influence decision-making and crime rates.  

---

### 🧠 Why Neuroscience?  
Crime is ultimately a behavior. This project connects data trends to neuroscience concepts like:  
- **Stress & Impulse Control:** Chronic stress impairs the prefrontal cortex, making impulsive behaviors more likely.  
- **Fear & Coercion:** Explains vulnerability to wrongful convictions and false confessions.  
- **Reward Systems:** How the brain’s dopamine circuits drive risk-taking behaviors.

### 📊 What This Repo Will Contain  
1. **Data Cleaning Notebook** – how raw data was prepared  
2. **4 Core Visualizations:**  
   - Violent crimes over time  
   - State-by-state crime intensity (heatmap)  
   - Crime type breakdown  
   - Predictive analysis (future trend estimate)  
3. **Neuroscience-based insights** for each graph

### 🧠 Neuroscience Insight: Crime Trends (1975–2015)

The graph above isn’t just about numbers. Neuroscience research suggests that crime patterns can be influenced by how the human brain responds to stress, trauma, and reward.  

- **Stress & Impulse Control:**  
  Chronic stress weakens the prefrontal cortex (the “logic and self-control” part of the brain) and strengthens the amygdala (emotion and fear). Periods of economic uncertainty or social unrest may amplify impulsive, fear-driven behaviors, potentially increasing crime rates.  

- **Reward Pathways:**  
  Crimes like robbery or assault can activate the same dopamine-based reward circuits as addictive behaviors. When legitimate opportunities for reward decrease, individuals may be more likely to seek “shortcuts” to those rewards.  

- **Generational Trauma:**  
  Communities exposed to long-term instability or discrimination can pass down epigenetic changes that affect stress regulation. This heightened baseline stress may correlate with increased crime rates in specific communities.  

> **Key Takeaway:** By combining crime data with neuroscience insights, we can better understand how external stressors and internal brain processes interact to influence societal behavior.

### 🔎 How We Arrived at This Conclusion  

1. **Step 1: Analyze the dataset (1975–2015)**  
   - We grouped the data by year and plotted violent crimes and subcategories.  
   - We noticed spikes in violent crime in the late 70s and early 90s, with a significant drop after the mid-90s.  

2. **Step 2: Overlay historical context**  
   - The spikes align with known periods of economic recession and high societal stress (e.g., 1980–82, early 90s).  
   - The sharp decline in the mid-90s coincides with improved mental health awareness, more stable economic conditions, and better community programs.  

3. **Step 3: Connect to neuroscience literature**  
   - Neuroscience shows that stress impairs the prefrontal cortex and heightens amygdala activation, leading to impulsive or fear-driven behaviors.  
   - Research on reward pathways and generational trauma further supports how chronic stress can increase crime rates.  

> **This is an interpretation, not causation:** We are not saying crime spikes were *caused* by these brain mechanisms. Instead, we’re using neuroscience as a lens to understand why large-scale stressors might influence criminal behavior.
